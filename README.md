#  Automation Testing Portfolio

Welcome to my Automation Testing Portfolio!  
This repository documents my learning journey as I upskill from **Manual Testing** to **Automation Testing** using modern tools and frameworks.

It includes structured hands-on practice, mini-projects, test scripts, and notes in the following areas:

##  Sample Projects

Below are some hands-on projects or test scenarios to showcase practical understanding:

- [E-commerce Website Automation](./Selenium/EcommerceLoginTest.java)
- [Book Store API Testing](./RestAssured/BookStoreAPI.java)
- [Mobile App Login Test](./Appium/LoginTest.java)
- [BDD Scenario - User Signup](./Cucumber/SignupFeature.feature)

> These projects demonstrate test automation frameworks, assertions, page object models, and integration with test tools.

## Objective

Iâ€™m transitioning into automation testing with strong foundations in:

- Functional and non-functional testing
- SDLC/STLC processes
- Defect lifecycle
- Test case design techniques
- Agile and JIRA-based testing environments

This GitHub profile will be continuously updated with real-world scenarios, scripts, and frameworks.
